    "body": "Context We are replacing Nautilus with Thunar to align with the \"Zero-Drag\" philosophy (lightweight, fast). We need to remove competing file managers, apply the system theme, and configure developer-centric custom actions.\n\nInstructions for Copilot Please generate the code/scripts to perform the following:\n\n1. Package Management (Arch)\n\nInstall:\n\nthunar (Core)\n\nthunar-archive-plugin (Right-click -> Extract)\n\nthunar-volman (USB auto-mount)\n\nfile-roller (Backend for archives)\n\ngvfs (Trash and mounting support)\n\ncatppuccin-gtk-theme-mocha (Theming)\n\npapirus-icon-theme (Clean folder icons)\n\nRemove:\n\nnautilus\ndolphin (if present)\nany other alt competing file manager\n\n2. System Integration\n\nDefault File Manager: Set Thunar as the default for opening folders: xdg-mime default thunar.desktop inode/directory\n\nHyprland Keybind: Update ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf: Change bind = $mainMod, E, ... to exec, thunar\n\nTheme Application: Generate a command to force the dark theme (GTK settings): gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme \"Catppuccin-Mocha-Standard-Blue-Dark\" gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme \"Papirus-Dark\"\n\n3. Configure Custom Actions (~/.config/Thunar/uca.xml)\n\nGenerate the uca.xml file with these essential Developer Actions:\n\n\"Open in VS Code\"\n\nCommand: code %f\n\nIcon: visual-studio-code\n\n\"Open in Kitty\"\n\nCommand: kitty --directory %f\n\nIcon: kitty\n\n\"Copy Path\"\n\nCommand: echo -n %f | wl-copy\n\nIcon: edit-copy\n\nDefinition of Done:\n\nSuper + E opens Thunar instantly.\n\nThunar is dark and matches the Catppuccin Mocha palette.\n\nRight-clicking a folder shows \"Open in VS Code\" and \"Open in Kitty\".\n\nNautilus is removed from the system.",
